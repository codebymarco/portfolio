          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, designed to
            build fast, scalable web applications. One of its core features is
            middleware, which allows you to handle requests, responses, and
            logic between client and server effectively. This article explores
            how middleware functions in Express.js and how it can enhance your
            web application development.

        <div className="blog-section">
          <h2>Key Concepts of Middleware in Express</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              **Middleware Definition**: Middleware functions are functions
              that have access to the request object (`req`), the response
              object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the
              application’s request-response cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Function Chaining**: Middleware functions are executed in
              sequence. After one function completes, it passes control to the
              next function using `next()`.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Types of Middleware**: There are several types of middleware,
              including application-level, router-level, error-handling, and
              built-in middleware.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2>Using Middleware in Express.js</h2>
          <p>
            Middleware is the backbone of any Express.js application. By using
            it effectively, you can handle tasks like logging requests,
            authenticating users, parsing data, and more. Here’s an example of
            how to use middleware in Express:
          </p>
          <pre>
            {`
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// A simple logging middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(\`Received request at: \${req.url}\`);
  next();
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
`}
          </pre>
        </div>

        <div className="blog-section">
          <h2>Common Middleware Functions</h2>
          <p>
            There are many commonly used middleware packages that can simplify
            web development with Express.js. Some of the most popular ones
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              **Body-parser**: Used to parse incoming request bodies in a
              middleware before handlers. It’s commonly used for processing
              JSON and URL-encoded form data.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Cors**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for
              handling requests from different origins.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Helmet**: A security-focused middleware that helps secure
              Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Morgan**: A logging middleware that helps track incoming
              requests, useful for debugging and monitoring.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="blog-section">
          <h2>Error-Handling Middleware</h2>
          <p>
            Express allows you to define custom error-handling middleware to
            catch and respond to errors in your application. Here's an example
            of an error-handling middleware:
          </p>
          <pre>
            {`
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
`}
          </pre>
        </div>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Middleware in Express.js is a powerful tool that helps developers
            create scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications. Whether
            you’re handling requests, parsing data, or implementing security
            features, understanding middleware will help you enhance your
            development workflow and build better applications.
