          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            ReactJS and VueJS are two of the most popular JavaScript frameworks
            for building modern web applications. While both have their
            strengths, choosing the right one depends on your project's needs
            and your development team's preferences.

          <h2>Key Differences Between React and Vue</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              **Learning Curve**: Vue is often praised for being more beginner
              friendly, while React requires a deeper understanding of concepts
              like JSX and state management.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Performance**: Both React and Vue offer excellent performance
              due to their efficient virtual DOM implementations.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Flexibility vs. Convention**: React offers greater flexibility
              with fewer built-in tools, whereas Vue provides a more structured
              and opinionated approach.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2>When to Choose React</h2>
          <p>
            React is ideal for projects that require a flexible, component-based
            architecture, particularly for large-scale applications.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="blog-section">
          <h2>When to Choose Vue</h2>
          <p>
            Vue is great for smaller to medium-sized applications and is loved
            for its ease of use and clear structure.
          </p>
