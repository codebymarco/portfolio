About
I'm a 25 year old self-taught developer, which means I don’t have a formal degree and I am getting old. After finishing high school, I started working for my dad—I had worked for him before, but that was more like child labor.
In 2021, I began watching coding tutorials on YouTube. Before I knew it, I went from creating UIs using HTML and CSS to building APIs and getting hired. Now, I’m approaching two years in the tech industry, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for me.
